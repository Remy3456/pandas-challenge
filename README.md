**Summarize the analysis.**

The summarized data includes academic performance metrics for various high schools, segmented by district, grade, spending per student, scores by school type and school size. For math and reading scores, charter schools such as Cabrera and Thomas consistently show higher averages across most grades, while district schools like Rodriguez and Figueroa High report lower averages. Schools are categorized by spending per student, with those spending less than $585, such as Cabrera and Holden, achieving higher scores and passing rates. In contrast, schools with higher spending, particularly between $630-$680 per student, tend to have lower passing rates, potentially due to larger enrollments. When segmented by size, small schools (less than 1000) achieve the highest average math and reading scores, along with the best overall passing rates. Larger schools, particularly those with over 2,000 students, generally exhibit lower scores, highlighting a possible inverse relationship between school size and student performance. This data reveals significant patterns connecting student outcomes to school type, budget allocation, and overall enrollment, offering insights for strategic educational improvements.

**Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations**

**1. Scores by Spending Range:**

**Lower Spending per Student Correlates with Higher Academic Performance:** Schools with a per-student spending of less than $585 show the highest average math (83.46) and reading scores (83.93), along with the highest passing rates in both math (93.46%) and reading (96.61%), resulting in an overall passing rate of 90.37%. This suggests that lower per-student spending is associated with better academic outcomes compared to higher spending brackets.

**Higher Spending Does Not Guarantee Higher Passing Rates:** As spending per student increases, academic performance, especially in terms of passing rates, declines. For instance, schools in the $630–645 spending range have an overall passing rate of 62.86%, significantly lower than the 90.37% passing rate for schools spending less than $585 per student. This indicates that factors other than spending may have a more significant impact on student success, potentially due to large enrollments.

**2. Scores by School Type and School Size:**
   
**Charter Schools Perform Better in Math and Reading:** Charter schools like Cabrera, Griffin, and Thomas High consistently show higher average math and reading scores than district schools such as Rodriguez and Figueroa High. For example, Cabrera High, a charter school, has an average math score of 83.06 and reading score of 83.98, compared to Rodriguez High, a district school, which has a math score of 76.84 and a reading score of 80.74. This trend extends to the passing rates, where charter schools generally show higher percentages in both math and reading.

**Higher Per-Student Spending Doesn’t Guarantee Better Performance:** Despite spending more per student, many district schools show lower passing rates compared to charter schools with lower per-student spending. For instance, Rodriguez High, with a per-student budget of $637, has an overall passing rate of 52.99%, while Holden High, a charter school with a per-student budget of $581, has a higher overall passing rate of 89.23%. This suggests that higher spending per student does not directly correlate with improved performance.
